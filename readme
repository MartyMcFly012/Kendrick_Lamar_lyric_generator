To run the app.py file you will need to install flask:
To install Flask, you can use pip, the package installer for Python. Follow these steps to install Flask:

---

Open a Command Prompt or Terminal: Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).

Install Flask: use pip to install Flask (or follow the below instructions to install pip in a virtual environment):
pip install flask

Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your project's
dependencies. If you haven't installed the venv module, you can do so using the following command:

python -m pip install --user virtualenv

Then, create a virtual environment for your Flask project.

Navigate to your project directory and run:
python -m venv venv
This will create a virtual environment named "venv" in your project directory.

Activate the Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
Depending on your operating system, activate the virtual environment:

Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install Flask: With the virtual environment activated, use pip to install Flask:
pip install flask

This command will download and install Flask and its dependencies.

Besides that, you will most likely need to run the following lines
cd app
FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run

Next, you will want to open your preferred browser and go to the provided
local server which may look something like this: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Finally, you can enjoy the objectively-defined art this app generates.

Curious minds might wish to look at the various models I experimented with using for language generation.
I may decide to add a feature for users to dynamically switch between models. But that is a problem for future me.
Thanks for checking out my project I hope you enjoy what I was able to accomplish here.
